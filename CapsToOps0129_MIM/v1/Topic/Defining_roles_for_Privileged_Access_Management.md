# Defining roles for Privileged Access Management
## Oveview

A typical way to define roles needed for privileged access management is to construct and review a spreadsheet that lists the roles, and identifies the governance requirements and the permissions required by each role.

The governance requirements will vary depending upon any existing identity and access policies or compliance requirements which the privileged access management controls are intended to address. The parameters to identify for each role might include identifying the owner of the role, the candidate users who can be in that role, and determining what authentication, approval or notification controls should be associated with the use of the role.

The role permissions will depend upon the applications being managed. This article uses as an example application Active Directory itself, dividing the permissions into two categories:

- Those needed to manage the Active Directory service itself (e.g., configure the replication topology)

- Those needed to manage the data held in Active Directory (e.g., create user and groups)

## Role selection considerations

To get started, create a tab in a spreadsheet, and list each potential role in a row. To find the appropriate roles, identify the applications in scope for management (are they in tier 0, tier 1 or tier 2?), and the privileges that impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the application. Also consider any dependencies the application might have on other components of the system, such as databases, network or security infrastructure, or the virtualization or hosting platform. Then determine how to group those privileges so that users who are administrators can easily select the appropriate role, without inadvertently receiving too many permissions.

The goal for role modeling is to design for the least privilege assignment. This can be based on the current (or planned) organizational responsibilities for users, and would include the privilege required by the user's duties. It could also include the privileges that simplify operations, without creating risk.

Other considerations in scoping the permissions to include a role are:

- How many individuals are working in a particular role? If there are not at least 2, then it may be premature to define a role if no one would be exercising it, or are defined by a particular person's duties.

- How many roles does a person take on? Would users be able to select the right role for their task?

- Would the user population and how they interact with the applications be compatible with privileged access management?

- Is it possible to separate administration and audit, so that a user in an administrative role cannot erase the audit records of their actions?

An example list of roles is included at the end of this section.

## Role governance requirements

As you identify candidate roles, start to fill out the spreadsheet. Create columns for the requirements which are relevant to your organization, and for each role, specify the choices for each:

- Who is the role owner that would be responsible for the further definition of role, choosing permissions, and maintaining the governance settings (change to how account is accessed, used, etc.) for the role?

- Who are the role holders (users) who will perform the role duties or tasks?

- What access method (discussed in the next section) would be appropriate for the role holders?

- Is manual approval by a role owner required when a user activates their role?

- Is notification required when a user activates their role?

- Should use of this role generate an alert or notification in a SIEM system, for tracking purposes?

- Is it necessary to restrict users activating the role to only be able to log onto computers where access is required to perform the role duties, and where there is sufficient verification of the host that it will be able to secure the privileges/credentials from misuse?

- Is it required to provide a dedicated admin workstation to the role holders?

- Which application permissions (see example list for AD) are associated with this role?

## Selecting an access method

There may be multiple roles in a privileged access management system with the same permissions assigned to them, if different communities of users have distinct access governance requirements. For example, an organization may choose to apply different policies for their own full-time employees acting as administrators, than for outsourced IT employees of another organization acting as administrators.

In some cases, a user may be permanently assigned to a role, and so they do not need to request or activate a role assignment. Examples of permanent assignment scenarios include:

- A managed service account in existing forest

- A user account in the existing forest, with a credential managed outside of PAM (for example, a "break glass" account, in which a role such as "Domain / DC maintenance" needed to fix trust and DC health problems is permanently assigned to the account, with a physically secured password)

- A user account in the administrative forest who authenticates with a password (for example, a user who needs permanent 24x7 administrative permissions and logs on from a device which cannot support strong authentication)

- A user account in the administrative forest, with a smartcard or virtual smartcard (for example, an account with an offline smartcard, needed for rare maintenance tasks)

MIM enables dynamic role based assignments, in which the privileges are temporarily assigned to a user with a workflow and optional approval process. This can apply both for a user account in the administrative forest who authenticates with a password, and for one who authenticates with a smartcard or virtual smartcard. For organizations concerned about the potential for credential theft or misuse, the [Using Azure MFA for activation](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt517876.aspx) guide includes instructions for how to configure MIM to require an additional out of band check at the time of role activation.

## Modeling delegated Active Directory permissions

When a new domain is created in Active Directory, Windows Server automatically creates well-known groups such as "Domain Admins". While these groups simplify getting started and may be suitable as is for smaller organizations, in larger organizations or those requiring more isolation of administrative privileges, a goal for privileged access management projects has been to empty groups like "Domain Admins" and replace their use with additional groups which provide fine-grained permissions.

One of the limitations of the Domain Admins group is that it grants permissions for three separate functions: managing the Active Directory service itself, managing the data held in Active Directory, and enabling remote logon onto domain joined computers. Another limitation of the Domain Admins group is that it cannot have members from an external domain. So in its place, an organization could create new security groups that provide only the necessary permissions, and use MIM to dynamically provide administrator accounts with those group memberships.

### Example Active Directory service management permissions

The following table gives examples of permissions which would be relevant to include in roles for managing AD.

| Role | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| Domain/DC Maintenance | Membership in the Domain\Administrators group that allows for troubleshooting and altering the domain controller operating system, promoting a new domain controller into an existing domain in the forest and AD role delegation.
|Manage Virtual DCs | Manage domain controller (DC) virtual machines (VMs) using the virtualization management software. This privilege may be granted via full control of all virtual machines in the management tool or by using the Role-based access control (RBAC) functionality. |
| Extend Schema | Manage the schema including extending it to include new object definitions and alter permissions to schema objects and alter schema default permissions for object types |
| Backup Active Directory Database | Take a backup copy of the Active Directory Database in its entirety, including all secrets entrusted to the DC and the Domain. |
| Manage Trusts and Functional Levels | Create and delete trusts with external domains and forests. |
| Manage Sites, Subnets and Replication | Manage the Active Directory replication topology objects including modifying sites, subnets, and site link objects and initiate replication operations |
| Manage GPOs | Create, delete and modify Group Policy Objects throughout the domain |
| Manage Zones | Create, delete and modify DNS Zones and objects in the Active Directory |
| Modify Tier 0 OUs | Modify Tier 0 OUs and contained objects in the Active Directory |

### Example Active Directory data management permissions

The following table gives examples of permissions which would be relevant to include in roles for managing or using the data held in AD.

| Role | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| Modify Tier 1 Admin OU                 | Modify OUs containing Tier 1 Admin objects in the Active Directory |
| Modify Tier 2 Admin OU                 | Modify OUs containing Tier 2 Admin objects in the Active Directory |
| Account Management: Create/Delete/Move | Modify standard user accounts                                      |
| Account Management: Reset Unlock       | Reset passwords and unlock accounts                                  |
| Security Group: Create Modify          | Create and modify security groups in Active Directory              |
| Security Group: Delete                 | Delete security groups in Active Directory                         |
| GPO Management                         | Manage all GPOs in domain/forest that don't affect Tier 0 servers             |
| Join PC/Local Admin                    | Local administrative rights to all workstations                               |
| Join Srv/Local Admin                   | Local administrative rights to all servers                                    |

## Example role definitions

The choice of role definitions will depend upon the tier of servers being managed by the privileged accounts. It will also depend upon the choice of applications being managed, since applications like Exchange or third party enterprise products such as SAP will often bring their own additional role definitions for delegated administration.

The following sections give examples for typical enterprise scenarios.

### Tier 0 - Administrative forest

Role suitable for accounts in the bastion environment might include:

- Emergency access to the administrative forest
- "Red Card" admins: users who are administrators of the administrative forest
- Users who are administrators of the production forest
- Users who are delegated limited administrative rights to applications in the production forest

### Tier 0 - Enterprise production forest

Roles suitable for managing the tier 0 production forest accounts and resources might include:

- Emergency Access to the production forest
- Group Policy admins
- DNS admins
- PKI admins
- AD Topology and Replication admins
- Virtualization admins for Tier 0 servers
- Storage admins
- Anti-Malware admins for Tier 0 servers
- SCCM admins for Tier 0 SCCM
- SCOM Admins for Tier 0 SCOM
- Backup admins for Tier 0
- Users of out-of-band and baseboard management controllers (for KVM or lights-out management) connected to Tier 0 hosts

### Tier 1

Roles for management and backup of servers in Tier 1 might include:

- Server maintenance
- Virtualization admins for Tier 1 servers
- Security Scanner Account
- Anti-Malware admins for Tier 1 servers
- SCCM admins for Tier 1 SCCM
- SCOM admins for Tier 1 SCOM

Also, roles for managing enterprise applications in Tier 1 might include:

- DHCP administrators
- Exchange administrators
- Skype for Business administrators
- SharePoint farm administrators
- Administrators of a cloud service, e.g., a company Web Site or public DNS
- Administrators of HCM, Financial or Legal systems
