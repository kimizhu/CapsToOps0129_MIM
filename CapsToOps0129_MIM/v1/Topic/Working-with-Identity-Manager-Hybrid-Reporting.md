# Working with Identity Manager Hybrid Reporting

## Available hybrid reports
The first three Microsoft Identity Manager reports available in Azure AD are **Password reset activity**, **Password reset registration** and **Self-service groups activity**.

-   Password reset activity displays each instance when a user performed password reset using the SSPR and provides the gates or **Methods** used for authentication.

-   Password reset registration displays each time a user registers for the SSPR and the **Methods** used to authenticate, for example a mobile phone number or questions and answers.
    Note that for Password reset registration, no differentiation is made between SMS gate and MFA gate – both are considered **Mobile Phone**.

-   Self-service groups activity displays each attempt made by someone to add themselves to or delete themselves from a group and group creation.

> [!NOTE]
> The reports currently present data for up to one month back.
> 
> If you want to uninstall hybrid reports, uninstall the MIMreportingAgent.msi agent.

## Prerequisites

1.  Install Microsoft Identity Manager 2016 including the MIM service.

2.  Make sure you have an Azure AD Premium tenant with a licensed administrator in your directory.

3.  Make sure you have outgoing Internet connectivity from the Microsoft Identity Manager server to Azure.

## Installing Microsoft Identity Manager Reporting in Azure AD
After the reporting agent is installed, the data from Microsoft Identity Manager activity is exported from Microsoft Identity Manager to windows event log. The Microsoft Identity Manager reporting agent processes the events, and uploads to Azure. In Azure, the events are parsed, decrypted, and filtered for the required reports.

1.  Install Microsoft Identity Manager 2016.

2.  Download the Microsoft Identity Manager reporting agents:

    1.  Log into the Azure AD management portal and click on the Active Directory icon.

    2.  Double click on the directory for which you are a Global Administrator and you have an Azure AD Premium subscription.

    3.  Click **Configuration** and download the reporting agent.

3.  Install the Microsoft Identity Manager reporting agent:

    1.  Create a directory on the computer.

    2.  Extract the files `MIMHybridReportingAgent.msi` and `tenant.cert` into the directory.

    3.  Run the agent installer.

    4.  Make sure that the Microsoft Identity Manager reporting agent service is running

    5.  Restart the Microsoft Identity Manager Service.

4.  Validate that Microsoft Identity Manager Reporting is working in Azure.

    You can create report data by using the Microsoft Identity Manager Self Service Password Reset Portal to reset a user’s password. Make sure that the password reset completed successfully and then check that the data is displayed in the Azure AD management portal.

## Viewing hybrid reports in the Azure management portal

1.  Log into Azure with your global admin account for the tenant.

2.  Click the **Active Directory** icon.

3.  Select the tenant directory from the list of available directories for your subscription.

4.  Click **Reports** and then **Password Reset Activity**.

5.  Make sure you select **Identity Manager** in the source drop down menu.

> [!WARNING]
> It can take some time for Microsoft Identity Manager data to appear in Azure AD.

## Stop sending Microsoft Identity Manager events to Azure
If you want to stop uploading reporting data from Microsoft Identity Manager to Azure Active Directory, you should uninstall the hybrid reporting agent. Using the Windows **Add or Remove Programs** tool, uninstall Microsoft Identity Manager Hybrid Reporting.

## Windows Events Used for Microsoft Identity Manager Reporting in Azure AD
Events generated by Microsoft Identity Manager are logged in the Windows Event Log, and are visible in the Event Viewer under: Application and Services logs-&gt; **Identity Manager Request Log**. Each Microsoft Identity Manager request is exported as an event in the Windows Event Log in JSON structure. This can be exported to your SIEM.

|Event type|ID|Event details|
|--------------|------|-----------------|
|Information|4121|FIM event data that includes all the request data.|
|Information|4137|FIM event 4121 extension, in the case there is too much data for a single event. The header in this event is in the following form: `"Request: <GUID> , message <xxx> out of <xxx>`|
