## Configure MIM Sync to Synchronize from Active Directory to MIM Service
By default, MIM Sync does not have any connectors configured.   A typical first step is to use MIM Sync to populate the FIM Service database with existing Active Directory accounts.  For this, you will use the MIM Sync Service application.

### Create the MIM MA
The MIM MA is a connector for MIM Sync to the MIM Service. To create this connector, you use the Create Management Agent wizard.

When you configure a MIM management agent, you need to specify a user account. This document uses mimma as name for this account.

> [!CAUTION]
> The account you use for your MIM management agent must be the same account as the one you have specified during the installation of MIM Service.

To create the MIM MA

-   Open the Synchronization Service Manager.

-   To open the Create Management Agent wizard, on the Actions menu, click **Create**.

-   On the Create Management Agent page, provide the following settings, and then click **Next**.

    -   To apply the attribute flow configuration, click OK.

8.  On the Summary tab, click Submit.

### Initializing the testing environment
Before you can test your configuration with your AD data, you need to initialize the configuration. The following steps are part of this process:

-   Enabling provisioning

-   Initializing the MIMMA

-   Configuring attribute flow precedence

-   Initializing the ADMA

##### To enable Provisioning

1.  Open the Synchronization Service Manager.

2.  To open the Options dialog box, on the Tools menu, click Options

3.  Select Enable Synchronization Rule Provisioning.

4.  To close the Options dialog box, click OK.

##### To initialize the MIMMA

1.  run a complete synchronization cycle on this connector. The complete cycle consists of the following run profile runs:

    -   Full Import

    -   Full Synchronization

    -   Export

    -   Delta Import

2.  Open the Synchronization Service Manager and on the Tools menu, click Management Agents.

3.  In the Management Agents list, select MIMMA

4.  To open the Run Management Agent dialog box, on the Actions menu, click Run.

5.  For each row in the table immediately above this procedure, complete the following steps:

    -   To open the Run Management Agent dialog box, on the Actions menu, click Run.

    -   In the Run profiles list, select the run profile shown for that row in the table.

6.  To start the run profile, click OK.

##### Configuring attribute flow precedence

1.  During the initialization of the MIM connector, the configured synchronization rules have been brought into the metaverse.

2.  Adjust the attribute flow precedence for the attributes contributed by this connector to ensure that attributes already in AD can flow into the metaverse and later also into the MIM Service database.

##### Initializing the ADMA

1.  To initialize the Active Directory connector, you need to run a full import and a full synchronization on it. The full import is required to bring the existing objects from AD into the connector space. The full synchronization is required because the synchronization rules have changed by projecting the new synchronization rules from the MIM connector space into the metaverse.

    -   Step 1: Run Full Import

    -   Step 2: Run Full Synchronization

2.  Open the Synchronization Service Manager and in the Tools menu, click Management Agents.

3.  In the Management Agents list, select ADMA.

4.  To open the Run Management Agent dialog box, on the Actions menu, click Run.

5.  For each row in the table immediately above this procedure, complete the following steps:

    -   To open the Run Management Agent dialog box, on the Actions menu, click Run.

    -   In the Run profiles list, select the run profile shown for that row in the table.

6.  To start the run profile, click OK.

##### Populating the MIM Service database

1.  To populate the MIM Service database with the objects, you need to run a synchronization cycle on the MIMMA connector. The cycle consists of the following run profile runs:

    -   1: Export

    -   2: Full Import

    -   3: Full Sync

2.  Open the Synchronization Service Manager and on the Tools menu, click Management Agents.

3.  In the Management Agents list, select MIMMA

4.  To open the Run Management Agent dialog box, on the Actions menu, click Run.

5.  For each row in the table immediately above this procedure, complete the following steps:

    -   To open the Run Management Agent dialog box, on the Actions menu, click Run.

    -   In the Run profiles list, select the run profile shown for that row in the table.

6.  To start the run profile, click OK.
