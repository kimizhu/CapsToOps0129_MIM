# Microsoft Identity Manager 2015 Public Preview
Microsoft Identity Manager (MIM) 2015 is the upcoming version of Microsoft’s identity and access management (IAM) product suite, and replaces Forefront Identity Management (FIM) 2010R2.

MIM provides identity data management and synchronization, authentication and authorization workflows, and self-service identity management capabilities for end-users – group management, credentials management, certificate management, etc.

There are two common ways to deploy a MIM 2015 solution (both are covered in this TLG):

-   Deploying the system on a fresh server.

-   Upgrading an existing FIM 2010 R2 system to MIM 2015.

## In This Guide
The goal of this guide is to help customers deploy MIM 2015, either on a fresh environment or on top of FIM 2010 R2, using the same product installation kit.
This guide is intended for enterprise identity management asset administrators, responsible for deploying and installing on-premises enterprise identity and access management systems.
