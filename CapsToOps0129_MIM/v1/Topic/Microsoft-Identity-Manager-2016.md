# Microsoft Identity Manager 2016
MIM 2016 builds on the already strong identity and access management capabilities of FIM 2010 R2 and adds hybrid experience and privilege access management capabilities as well as support for new platforms.

## Hybrid experience
Microsoft Identity Manager 2016 provides support for hybrid reporting from MIM included in Azure AD reports. In addition, the Self Service Password Reset portal supports Azure multi-factor authentication (MFA).

## Privileged Identity Management
Privileged Identity Management controls and manages administrative access by providing temporary, task-based access to sensitive resources eliminating the carte blanche administrative access coveted by cyber attackers. In addition, Privileged Identity Management extracts and isolates administrative accounts from existing Active Directory forests.

## Modernization
This version of Microsoft Identity Manager provides new features such as Privileged Identity Manager and support in Certificate Management for REST API access. In Certificate Management there is now added support for multi-forest topologies, a Windows store app for virtual smartcard and certificate lifecycle management, updated events and troubleshooting capabilities. Self-service scenarios now include Account Unlock and multifactor authentication gate for Password Reset.

MIM supports an updated list of products and platforms including the latest Microsoft platforms and Office/server stacks, Windows Client OS, Windows Server OS, SharePoint, SQL and Outlook, specifically:

-   Windows 8.1 with Internet Explorer 8 and higher

-   Windows Server 2012 R2

-   SQL 2014

-   Outlook 2013

-   System Center Service Manager 2012 and 2012 R2
